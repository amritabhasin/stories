     <p><p>  Alas, I miss the days of fun and play,</p> <p>  Splurging on candy, donning fairy wings,</p> <p>  Such surprises sprang each and every day,</p> <p>  Carousels, clowns, water balloons and swings,</p> <p>  The days got longer; spring led to summer,</p> <p>  Building sandcastles, collecting seashells,</p> <p>  Leaves changed color- I thought: What a bummer,</p> <p>  Splashing in the water, seeking cockleshells,</p> <p>  One day it seemed my childhood had passed,</p> <p>  Homework, tests and essays consume my time,</p> <p>  I find that now life moves much too fast,</p> <p>  The morning clock sounding its daily chime,</p> <p>  All things pass like the changing of seasons,</p> <p>  Life flows; a mystery following its own reasons.</p></p>
