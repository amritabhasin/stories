<h>  <center> <font size="12"> Lovestruck Fan </center> </font> </h>

<font size="8"> <p>   His hair is flawless; his eyes are perfect, </p>  

<p> His music: my very inspiration,</p>

<p>His dreamy face is another aspect, </p>

<p>Singing to me in each situation,</p>

<p>But lighting up a smile on the faces,</p>

<p>Of countless devoted, adoring fan,</p>

<p>Does not equal knowing his embraces,</p>

<p>Alas, for him, I would fly to Japan,</p>

<p>Because it pains my heart to love and yearn,</p>

<p>So unattainable; yet I persist,</p>

<p>For someone who will not love in return,</p>

<p>Or know me, nor that I even exist,</p>

<p>For his blood type does lie in the B+ zone,</p>

<p>But- oh dear, I cannot recall my own.</p> </font>
