                                        <p><p>  &ldquo;The Running Girl&rdquo; is a young adult crime novel set in England. The novel chronicles the story of Garvie, a teenager who takes it upon himself to solve the murder of his ex-girlfriend by helping Inspector Singh, the policeman assigned to the case. Garvie is a math genius with a very high IQ who chooses to be a slacker. Throughout the book, he discovers many clues that lead him to eventually uncover the truth about Chloe Dow, the girl who was murdered.</p> <p>  <br />  The book was very compelling with many red herrings and twists. The plot was fast-paced and definitely kept me on tenterhooks. I didn&rsquo;t know who the murderer was until the end of the book because the plot and suspects kept changing. The only issue I had with the book was that I didn&rsquo;t like the main character, Garvie. I didn&rsquo;t really understand his personality, and I found it difficult to connect with him as a reader. However, he is definitely an unconventional and interesting character.</p> <p>  <br />  One aspect that I enjoyed about &ldquo;The Running Girl&rdquo; was the diversity among the characters. Garvie is from Barbados, and Inspector Singh is Sikh, which isn&rsquo;t a religion you often see portrayed in teen young adult books. As a Sikh, this was very compelling to me. Garvie and Inspector Singh are foils to each other, and their relationship is an amusing part of the book. Chloe Dow is a fascinating character because everybody thinks they know exactly who she is, but her secrets shock everybody in the end.</p> <p>  <br />  The main themes in this book are social commentary, violence, crime and assault.</p> <p>  <br />  Overall, &ldquo;The Running Girl&rdquo; is definitely a must-read. I would recommend this book to crime novel fans, Sherlock Holmes fans and anybody who wants to read a thought-provoking and engaging mystery novel.</p></p>
