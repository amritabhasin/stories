                                        <p><p>  Finally summer had arrived. Summer, that wonderful time when the sun is shining and everyone is outside hanging around eating ice cream, just watching the world go by. What summer meant to me was ten whole weeks of no school, no teachers, and no homework. It was the time when I could do whatever I wanted. I could sleep in and go to sleep late. I could ride my bike. I could open a lemonade stand. I could go to the beach. I determined that it was going to be the best summer ever.<br />  But, that was before my dad announced we were going to India to visit Grandma and Grandpa. This did not appeal to me at all. Don’t get me wrong. I love my grandparents but I was looking forward to long summer days hanging out with my friends or going to the beach with my family. And from what I can remember, my grandparents lived hundreds of miles from any beach and what was worse I had no friends where we were going.<br />  I said to my dad, “Do we really have to go?”<br />  “Yes we do, Nikki. You haven’t seen your grandparents since you were five and they would really love to see you,” he replied wearily.<br />  “Can’t we go someplace more interesting like Hawaii?”<br />  “No. We’re going to India and that’s that.”<br />  “But ----”<br />  “No ifs and buts. We leave in two days. So you should pack while you have the time.”<br />  I went to my room and sulked for a while. Eventually I got to the task of packing. I shoved some clothes, toiletries, my IPod, headphones, and pretty much an entire library of books into the suitcase. Since I could remember pretty much next to nothing about India from my last trip six years ago, I made a mental note to bring along a travel guide to read on the plane.<br />  Two days went by and soon enough I was at the airport boarding the plane with my dad. I’m going to leave out all the boring details of the plane trip except for when a passenger on the other side of me spilled a ginormous bottle of Coke on me. Trust me, it was not a pretty scene.<br />  We landed in New Delhi at an unearthly hour. I was drowsy and jet-lagged and almost fell over when we got off. We went to a hotel and I slept for a really long time. The next day, we spent time sightseeing and shopping in Delhi.  My dad took me to see the older historic part of Delhi. The streets were narrow and crowded. It was an unfamiliar setting for me. I found myself getting pushed and shoved by the flow of people. I grasped my purse tightly. Better to be safe than sorry, I told myself.  But soon enough as I observed my surrounding I became more at ease and enchanted by the sights around me. I saw vendors by the roadside selling bangles, jewelry, toys and all kinds of knickknacks. The air was full of exotic scents from burning incense sticks.  In the distance I could see the towers and walls of the ancient Red Fort of Delhi.  I saw three wheeled colorful rickshaws weaving through the crowded alleys. The noise and the sights, the hustle and bustle of the streets were all so exciting and overwhelming and just so different from the quiet neighborhood of my hometown back in America.<br />  The following day we hired a large car with a driver to drive us to my grandparent’s home in Nainital, a long ten-hour drive by road from Delhi. It took us more than an hour just to leave the congested roads of Delhi behind us. For lack of anything to do, I spent most of the time looking out the window and observing this new country. There was constant traffic, horns honking, people on the streets, stray dogs and the occasional sight of a cow by the side of the road, the loud sounds of merchants hawking their wares: “A dozen mangoes for only 100 Rupees!” It was different from America. Everything was just so different.<br />  As we left the outskirts of the city, the landscape changed to a more rural and less inhabited setting. Miles and miles of open countryside stretched before us. I saw farmers working their fields, cattle by the roadside and small villages as we made our way. At some point I must have dozed off. I must have slept a long time because when I awoke, we were driving through what seemed to be a thick forest. The sight of monkeys that leapt from one tree to another startled me. At one point, a large group of monkeys sat blocking the road. The driver had to blow the horn loudly to frighten them away.  My face was glued to the window watching these sights.<br />  After several miles we emerged from the forest and the road started to climb up the mountains. The scenery was rapidly changing. The road wound like a silver ribbon around the green mountains. Above us was a vast blue sky. I had to admit it was really beautiful.<br />  After a while, we passed a small village with a giant statue of a monkey. I cried out. “ Look! Hanuman!” Our driver turned around and stared at me with amusement. Hanuman is the Hindu monkey god. I had read about Hanuman in some Indian storybooks my mom had bought me.<br />  Eventually, we arrived in the town of Nainital.  It was high up in the Himalayan Mountains and much cooler than Delhi.<br />  When we reached my grandparent’s house, Grandpa and Grandma came out and started hugging me and claimed in astonished tones how tall I was.<br />  After the introductions and welcomes, once I was alone in my room, the first thing I did was stretch out on the bed, plug in my IPod, and listen to some of my favorite tunes. For dinner, grandma made roti, an Indian flatbread, dal, a lentil soup, and paneer, Indian cheese. It wasn’t that bad but I longed for Pizza, fries and a coke.<br />  Before I went to bed, I took off my locket that I always wear and placed it on the windowsill.<br />  You know the expression ‘fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow’? Well, I swear I was fast asleep the instant my head touched the pillow. Unfortunately, at around 1:15 in the morning I woke up as the jet lag kicked in. I lay awake for a long time listening to the sounds outside. I could hear the wind blowing through the trees, and the rustling of leaves among what sounded like some small animals scuttling outside. It was actually kind of spooky, to tell you the truth.<br />  The next day was pretty boring. We stayed home to rest and recover from our travels. I pretty much read and listened to music all day.  Grandma and grandpa fussed over me and asked me a thousand questions about my school and life in America.  Later in the afternoon, I walked around the streets nearby, observing everything around me with great curiosity.<br />  Before bed, I placed my locket on the windowsill as I had done the night before. In the middle of the night, I got up. Finding the room a little stuffy, I opened the window halfway and then climbed back into bed. I thought I heard some strange sounds but other than that, it was a much better night.<br />  The next morning, I got up and reached for my locket, but to my surprise, it wasn’t there. I searched everywhere in the room for it but it was gone. Completely vanished. It wasn’t valuable but it was a pretty object and it just meant a lot to me. Over breakfast, I mentioned my missing locket. Grandma and Grandpa were both very surprised.<br />  Grandma said, “I don’t know where it could have gone, darling. Was it valuable?”<br />  “No Grandma.”<br />  Grandpa puzzled over this for a while. Then he said, “I wonder if it could have been the cleaning lady.”<br />  We left it at that. After breakfast, Grandma handed me a list and asked me, “Can you go to the grocery store and get these items?  Low fat milk please”<br />  “Okay.”<br />  So I set out to the store. I was just putting my shoes on when I saw the cleaning lady walking out.<br />  I wonder if it could have been the cleaning lady. Hmm…<br />  Okay, fine. I knew it was wrong. But I wanted to know. And besides, I didn’t have much to do. I stared at the grocery list in thought. It could wait. I was going to follow the cleaning lady.<br />  The cleaning lady was a short woman of about thirty. The first thing I realized about her was that she limped when she walked. I followed her for a really long time keeping several steps behind her.<br />  I was starting to see a serious change in background as I followed her. The area where my grandparents lived looked safer, cleaner and the houses were made of wood and brick. The houses around here were smaller and made out of mud and didn’t look so clean.<br />  I didn’t like my surroundings. I was about to chicken out and go back when the cleaning lady stopped in front of a small mud hut and went inside. Was this where she lived?<br />  I saw a little girl maybe two or three years younger than me playing hopscotch with a stone near the hut. Her clothes were ragged and old. Her hair was untidy. I stood and watched her for a long time. After some time, the cleaning lady called out from inside and the little girl went in.<br />  I had never seen a mud hut before. I was curious to know what it was like inside. I crept closer to one of the small windows. Hidden and crouched, I watched.<br />  The hut was small, maybe the size of my bedroom. There were two old blankets on the floor. They didn’t look like they could keep out the cold. A chair and a table occupied a corner of the hut.  A small cooking stove and some pots were in another corner.<br />  Just then the cleaning lady glanced at the window and almost saw me. My heart started beating real fast. I hastily looked away. I had seen enough. I had never known anybody who lived like this. Here I was holding an expensive IPod and it was obvious these people had next to nothing. They couldn’t even afford a bed. I quietly walked back in deep thought.<br />  I was quieter than usual that day. Even my grandfather noticed. He probably thought I was missing my locket.<br />  The next few days we did some fun stuff. I went boating on the lake, I went horseback riding in the narrow trails through the hills. I went on a long hike with my dad up a mountain. When we reached the top, I looked down and realized the lake was pear shaped!<br />  I had forgotten all about my locket. The next night though, something odd happened. I had fallen asleep when I woke up hearing a really strange noise . It sounded like a gurgle followed by some thumps.<br />  It seemed to be coming from outside the window. The window was open because it was a pretty warm night.<br />  Curious, I threw the covers off and got out of bed. It was actually close to dawn so there was some light. Nevertheless, I grabbed a flashlight and threw on a nightgown and slippers.<br />  And yes, I know you might find it hard to believe, but I climbed right through the window. <br />  There it was again. Thump thump.<br />  I curiously walked forward. What could it be? There couldn’t be a wild animal out there, could there? I really didn’t know what to think.<br />  Thump thump.<br />  I pushed forward. I wasn’t really sure where I was going but it couldn’t be that far out.<br />  I kept following the strange thumping and eventually arrived at the edge of a wood.<br />  Thump thump.<br />  I clicked on my flashlight and looked.<br />  And could not believe one bit what I saw.<br />  Monkeys.<br />  The mischievous animals were gathered at the edge of the wood. There were two big monkeys and one baby monkey.<br />  And the baby monkey was wearing my locket.<br />  It was playfully taking the locket off its neck and putting it on again.<br />  I laughed out loud. Nobody had stolen my locket. It was the monkeys all along. Wait till my friends heard about this.<br />  Still laughing I crept forward. I accidently stepped on some branches. Crunch crunch.<br />  The monkeys suddenly scared, backed away and scampered off into the woods. In their hurry, they dropped my locket on the ground. I walked over and picked it up. I shook my head.<br />  The mystery was solved.<br />  I went back to the house and crept back into bed. That morning at breakfast, I excitedly told Grandpa and Grandma what I’d discovered. We had a good laugh about it.<br />  “I knew there were monkeys around here but I never excepted them to steal your locket,” said Grandpa.<br />  “Yah. The baby monkey was wearing it. It was hilarious.”<br />  “I’ll bet it was. Well, I’m glad you got your locket back. Can you run to the store for me?” said Grandma.<br />  “Sure, but first, I have something to do.”<br />  I had already decided what I would do with the locket. I just hoped I could find my way back there.<br />  With some difficulty, I found the hut. The little girl was once again playing hopscotch in front of the hut. I crept forward not wanting to scare her. She backed away when she saw me, but I was determined.<br />  I held the locket out in front of me.<br />  “It’s for you.”<br />  She just stared at me.<br />  “What’s your name?”<br />  “Neha,” she shyly murmured. She had evidently decided to trust me.<br />  “That’s a pretty name.”<br />  I knelt down a little before her and once again held out the locket in front of me.<br />  This time she took it.<br />  “Thank you.” And those two words totally won me over.<br />  Neha ran inside probably to show her mother.<br />  I stood up, dusted myself off, and smiled. Then I turned and walked away.</p></p>
