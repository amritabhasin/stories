                                          <font size="8">    <p><p>  This was it. The last day on Earth.</p> <p>  The words echoed ominously in Annabelle’s mind. She watched her baby brother playing in the corner, his chubby fingers gripping the blocks tightly, and it occurred to her that he would never live to be two. She would never live to be thirteen. Annabelle glanced around her home, from the velvet curtains in the living room to her mother’s delicate chinaware on the kitchen table.<br />  Annabelle felt an irresistible rage bubbling inside of her. Her father had passed away a year earlier and she was still reeling from the shock. Annabelle had never confided in anybody about her father’s death because she didn’t forgive him for leaving her family.<br />  She knew that he didn’t want to die but she couldn’t help feeling angry that her father had left right at the time when she needed him the most.<br />  Annabelle’s mother appeared in the doorway as if she had anticipated her daughter’s apprehension.<br />  “Your father would have been very proud of you. You’ve been so strong, strong enough for all of us.” Annabelle’s mother glanced at her son playing in the corner. She sighed and moved towards her daughter.<br />  Annabelle turned around, resisting her mother’s comforting embrace. She couldn’t admit to her mother that the reason she was able to stay strong was because she hadn’t allowed herself to grieve and had instead used her anger for strength.<br />  Her mind flashed back to the newscast on television announcing the meteor’s incoming path.<br />  How pathetic that a television broadcast had been their death notice! They all deserved more than this.<br />  Annabelle needed somebody to blame for what was happening. She needed to believe that the world was ending for a reason.<br />  But everybody knows nature has a strange way of working and Annabelle knew she had to accept what was happening. In less than twelve hours, Earth would be nothing.</p> <p>  Mr. Bartley sat in his rocking chair. The chair had been in his family for years. His wife liked to lie and crochet and his children used to relax there and read before they went off to start their own families.<br />  But, now it was just Mr. Bartley sitting in the chair. He had watched his children grow up and move away, and he had been there for his wife as she uttered her last words.<br />  As a child, Mr. Bartley was an avid reader. He recalled reading a story about a boy who drank immortal water and ended up living forever. At first he believed it was a miracle but soon he began to realize it was a curse, because everyone he cared about died.<br />  A picture on the windowsill got Mr. Bartley’s eye. It had been taken years ago on a family trip in Barcelona. Mr. Bartley smiled bitterly, reminiscing a time that now seemed so far away.<br />  Mr. Bartley remembered the stories his grandfather had told him when he was a child. The California drought, North Korea teaming up with Russia and commencing World War 3…<br />  But Mr. Bartley realized that even if there were a way out of death, he wouldn’t have taken it.<br />  Perhaps it was because he was fortunate enough to live longer than most of the townspeople, but Mr. Bartley felt ready to die. Or maybe it was because he understood that there was no escaping the inevitable.</p> <p>  A single teardrop slid down Javier’s cheek. Until this moment, he hadn’t allowed himself to cry. He knew he had to be strong, if not for Liz then for his unborn baby. It pained Javier to think that he would never get to hold his son. He wouldn’t be there for his first steps or his first laugh or his first anything. Javier had only just found love and for the first time in his life, his future appeared bright with possibility.<br />  How was it that a hunk of rock could change everything? Javier dug his fingernails into his palm furiously.<br />  Maybe he would make it out alive. Maybe the meteor would miss Earth and everyone would be okay. Maybe it would change path and hit somewhere else.<br />  Javier felt a hand on his shoulder and whirled around. His wife Liz offered him a cup of coffee. Javier wiped his eye and downed the frothy drink. It occurred to him that this would be the last cup of coffee he would ever drink.<br />  All of a sudden the walls seemed to close in around him and Javier felt trapped.<br />  “Come on.”<br />  Liz hesitated. “Javier, I don’t know. They told us to stay inside.”<br />  “Come on! What’s the worst that could happen? You don’t want to spend your last day sitting at home drinking coffee.”<br />  Javier carefully led Liz through the woods, knocking away thorny branches along the way.<br />  “What’s this?” They were standing in Javier’s special spot that was surrounded by ivy and overlooked a small waterfall. Javier had discovered the secluded area one day when he was chopping trees. It was a place that was all his own and he often went there to sit and think. Javier and Liz climbed onto the rocks and sat there. For a long time, neither of them said anything. The two just sat there, relishing the musical sound of the water trickling over the rocks.<br />  Eventually, Javier held Liz’s hand and the two began the trek home.</p> <p>  That evening, a bell rang out across the valley. Everybody gathered their most valued possessions and gathered in the town square.<br />  The ground rumbled violently and the townspeople held on to each other. A bonfire was lit and slowly people started throwing their belongings in the fire. Above, the sky had exploded into a fiery mess.<br />  A feeling of impending doom hung over everyone.</p> <p>  Annabelle flung the picture of her father into the fire. It was the last one taken of him before his death and Annabelle knew that her father would have been proud.<br />  “I forgive you.” Annabelle smiled sadly and a kind of peace came over her for she knew that soon she would join her father and somehow, that made everything better.</p> <p>  As Mr. Bartley watched the flames consume his wedding ring, he had no regrets. As people panicked, he remained calm. The ring was his way of realizing that he was happy to have loved and lost, rather than to not have loved at all. And in that moment, Mr. Bartley realized that he was going to be okay. </p> <p>  Javier held a pacifier in his hand. Other people were holding photographs and toys and he’d even seen one man drop a ring in the fire. But, to Javier the pacifier felt right. He understood that what was happening couldn’t be controlled. He didn’t know if they were all pawns in a game, or subjects in a deadly experiment but Javier knew that he had done his best.<br />  The truth was that there were things that nobody could control. And although it was really unfair that Javier would never get to see his son, he couldn’t do anything but accept the truth. As Javier hugged Liz, he knew that he had done the right thing.</p> <p>  Across the town square, a revelation was happening. Rivals shook hands and mothers hugged daughters. It seemed that everybody was getting one last chance to leave Earth in peace.<br />  In that moment, nothing really seemed to matter. The sky turned black for the last time and a big, black cloud descended upon the valley.<br />  Everyone joined hands in a big circle.<br />   </p></p>
